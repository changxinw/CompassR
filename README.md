# CompassR

## Overview
We developed CompassR to support more in-depth analyses and visualizations of CRE-gene linkages. CompassR is an open source R package built upon [CompassDB](http://compass-db.com/). CompassR can be used to analyze and visualize CRE-gene linkages in one or multiple samples, and identify TFs whose motifs are enriched in selected CREs.
